            Young midfielder could come into the fold alongside the likes of
            Weston McKennie, Yunus Musah and Tyler Adams, but minutes would be
            hard to come by. The latter of the three, Adams, is set to return
            from injury in the first three months of the new year and when
            healthy, is the best of the bunch. However, constant injury problems
            have seen him absent from the pitch for nearly an entire year now.
            That said, the 2024 Paris Olympics are the perfect opportunity for
            Pukstas to show off his game to U.S. Soccer, with there being an
            expectation that he makes the roster. The journalist explained:
            "Rokas Pukstas is playing for Hajduk Split in Croatia but this boy
            is super talented. He signed a new deal until 2027. He's currently
            one of the best talents that are in the Croatian league and we know
            they produce a lot of talent, but now with this American boy the
            feeling is that something special is going to happen in the future.
            He extended the contract because he's very happy there and also the
            salary has been improved, but some clubs are already tracking him,
            especially in Germany. So remember his name because this guy is
            very, very talented. People at Hajduk Split believe he is going to
            be part of the United States national team at the World Cup in
            2026."

            Aleksandar Trajkovski with a brilliant player announcement.
            Aleksandar Trajkovski scored the goal that ended Italy's hopes of
            qualifying for the 2022 World Cup finals. The 31-year-old is an
            experienced striker who is reliable in front of goal. They are set

            Tottenham have signed 16-year-old defender Luka Vuskovic from
            Croatian side Hajduk Split. Spurs reportedly faced competition from
            Premier League rivals Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester City, but
            have completed the deal. Vuskovic will join Spurs in 2025 and has
            signed a deal until 2030. He has made 11 first-team appearances for
            Hajduk Split and has played for Croatia at youth level. Tottenham
            have announced the signing of 16-year-old defender Luka Vuskovic
            from Hajduk Split. Vuskovic will only join Spurs in 2025 and the
            deal will run until 2030. The deal is reportedly worth around £12m.
            He made his senior debut earlier this year, becoming the youngest
            player to ever feature in the Croatian top flight. It has been
            reported that Spurs saw off competition from Premier League rivals
            Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester City to secure the signing.
            Vuskovic has made 11 first-team appearances for Hajduk Split but has
            not played since this season due to injury. He has played for
            Croatia at youth level, playing for the Under-17 team five times.
            The announcement comes less than 24 hours after Tottenham claimed a
            2-2 draw at Arsenal in the north London derby. Spurs twice fought
            back to continue their unbeaten Premier League start under new
            manager Ange Postecoglou “Credit to the lads, I thought we were
            outstanding today against a top team, at a difficult venue,” said
            Postecoglou.

            Rokas Pukstas will remain with Croatian side Hajduk Split through
            June 2027 after signing a new long-term contract. The 19-year-old
            has chosen to remain in Croatia to continue his development despite
            mounting interest from some of Europe's biggest clubs. Sources close
            to 90min have confirmed that Manchester City, Chelsea and Newcastle
            were among the teams keen to tempt the American teenager with a move
            to the Premier League, while Lyon, Paris Saint-Germain, AC Milan,
            Inter and Roma also expressed an interest. Pukstas arrived at Hadjuk
            in 2020 but didn't make his first-team debut until two years later.
            Since breaking through, he has impressed hugely and has recorded
            seven goals and three assists across 34 appearances in all
            competitions. “Rokas arrived at our Academy in 2020 through talent
            scouting, and since then he has made great progress in all segments
            of the football game," a statement from Hajduk sporting director
            Mindaugas Nikoličius said. "He has exceptional qualities and that is
            the reason why we joined him to the first team already in the spring
            of 2022. He is a member of the Under-20 USA National Team and the
            Under-23 USA Olympic National Team."

            Kalinić returns to Poljud stadium after more than 12 years and will
            wear the number 9 shirt again. The 34-year-old arrives as a free
            agent after terminating his contract with Serie A side Hellas
            Verona.Kalinić grew up in the Hajduk system, going through all age
            categories at the club’s academy and becoming one of its most
            recognisable products in the recent history. He played a total of 79
            official matches for the first team and scored 44 goals. He left
            Poljud in 2009 in a then record transfer to English club Blackburn.
            Over the past 13 season he also played for the Ukrainian side
            Dnipro, Italian Serie A clubs Fiorentina, AC Milan and Roma, and for
            the Atletico Madrid in Spain. In his career, he scored over 170
            goals. He also represented Croatia 42 times, scoring 15 goals. “We
            all know very well what a accomplished footballer he is, he played
            for some of the world’s biggest clubs in the strongest leagues at
            the highest level of football. Nikola is now returning to his club,
            full of motivation to help us in the fight for trophies. That says
            enough about what kind of person he is, because despite more
            generous offers and the opportunity to stay in Italy, he chose to
            return to his football home. His appearance, personality and, in the
            end, the most important thing, and that is football quality, will
            bring a lot to our team. Not only in terms of football, but also in
            terms of being a role model, leader and he will help the whole team
            to rise to a higher level,” sports director Mindaugas Nikolicius
            said for Hajduk.hr. “Returning to Hajduk is a special moment in my
            life. I signed contracts with many clubs, big clubs, played for
            them, but Hajduk is the greatest for all of us who grew up here and
            we are emotionally attached to it. This is where I grew up, the
            place where I gained my football affirmation, in the end this is
            where I was born and this is where my people are. I will do my best
            to cheer up everyone who breathes for Hajduk and keep this moment
            and the emotion around the club as long as possible,” said Kalinić,
            who will presented at Poljud stadium today. Hajduk also released a
            video introducing the signing.
