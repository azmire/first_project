    <h2>Collection of information</h2>
    <h4>1. Information You provide us</h4>
    <p>
      We collect information provided directly to us. For example, for
      information shared directly with us when an account is created,
      participate in a meeting or use another product or service that integrates
      our Services, communicate through our text chat feature, use our calendar
      integration or email invitation feature, provide feedback, make a
      purchase, communicate with us via third-party platforms, such as LinkedIn,
      Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, request customer support, explicitly opt
      into our collection of specific data from you or otherwise communicate
      with us. The types of personal information we may collect include your
      name, username, email address, postal address, phone number, account login
      information for our accounts and accounts on video conferencing platforms,
      profile photo, your image and/or voice, social media profile ID, user
      presentations, text chat communications, feedback on our Services, hashed
      payment card value and other payment-related information, like your
      billing address, and any other information you choose to provide.
    </p>

    <h4>2.Informations we collect automatically</h4>
    <p>
      We collect information about your activity on our Services, such as visual
      and audio files that include users’ video input and output and users’
      audio input and output. Certain features and integrations of our Services
      will collect meeting details, including the names and email addresses of
      invitees and participants, the meeting subject and description, meeting
      location, and any included meeting access details, like the meeting ID. We
      notify users in the video conference that the meeting is being measured
      and data is being collected, and we provide details on why, along with an
      opt-out option . We provide notice giving meeting attendees an opportunity
      to opt out of collection of meeting information.
    </p>
    <h4>3. Information we derive</h4>
    <p>
      We may derive information or draw inferences about you based on the
      information we collect. Examples of information we may derive or infer
      include the following: We use audio and visual information to score user's
      affect and behavior during meetings and to produce analytics, like users’
      individual talk times; We also use audio and visual information, as well
      as other information like language, to infer certain demographic
      characteristics about users, which we use to improve our models and
      increase the accuracy of their output. We also infer users’ role during a
      meeting, such as the client or team manager;
    </p>
    <h4>4. Information we collect from other sources</h4>
    <p>
      We also obtain information about you from other sources. For example, we
      may collect personal information from the video conferencing platforms you
      use, from third-party data brokers who provide us with audio and visual
      data sets, or from other users, such as when they refer our Services to
      you. We may also collect personal information from third parties who use
      our Services to provide their own products and services or that integrate
      our Services into their products and services, such as those that
      integrate our Services into the social media filters they offer.
    </p>

    <h2>Use of information</h2>
    <p>
      We use the information we collect to analyze users’ participation during
      meetings, including monitoring and scoring user sentiment and engagement.
      We also use the information we collect to: When you create a new account,
      we will ask your consent to connect your Google or Microsoft account to
      your Read account, thereby providing us with access to your calendar. The
      calendar integration checks your schedule and determines which meetings to
      add our services to. When integrating with your Google or Microsoft
      calendar, Read stores calendar event titles, times, attendee information,
      and video conferencing access links. Calendar event timing and video
      conferencing access links are used to automatically include Read Dashboard
      on your calendar events. Calendar event titles and attendee information
      are used to customize and compute Read Dashboard's analytics for
      attendees. This data is not shared with third parties and is stored in an
      encrypted database. Monitor and analyze trends, usage, and activities in
      connection with our Services and generate reports with our analysis,
      including real-time reports and alerts; Make inferences and derive
      information about users and their organizations, including for purposes of
      compiling metrics about an organization’s or user’s participation in a
      meeting, as described above in Information We Derive; Provide, maintain,
      and improve our Services, including maintaining user accounts with us and
      using information to train and improve our models within our Services;
      Process transactions and send you related information, including
      confirmations, receipts, invoices, customer experience surveys, and recall
      notices; Respond to your comments and questions and provide customer
      service; Communicate with you about products, services, and events offered
      by Read AI and others and provide news and information that we think will
